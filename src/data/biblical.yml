    name: Adam
    verified: true
    description: Adam was the first human, uniquely made in God's image with mental abilities superior to all other earthly creatures. Following his expulsion from Eden, he lived to see the murder of his own son, the tragic moral decline, the building of a city, the development of musical instruments, and the forging of tools out of iron and copper. After 930 years, Adam returned to the ground from which he was taken, in the year 3096 B.C.E.

    description: Eve was the first woman and the last reported of God's earthly creative works, formed from Adam's rib to be his complement. While not in the company of her husband, she was thoroughly deceived by a serpent into eating the forbidden fruit and later induced Adam to join her in disobedience. Following their expulsion from Eden, she raised several children, including Cain, Abel, and Seth, and is noted for being the first person recorded to have used God's name, Jehovah.

    description: (Gen 7:6-11) The flood lasted for about 1 year. There was an incessant torrential downpour for “forty days and forty nights”; “the waters continued overwhelming the earth” a hundred and fifty days. (Ge 7:4, 12, 24) Five months after the downpour began, the ark “came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.” (Ge 8:4) It was nearly two and a half months later before “the tops of the mountains appeared” (Ge 8:5), another three months before Noah removed the ark’s covering to see that the earth had practically drained (Ge 8:13), and nearly two months later when the door was opened and the survivors set foot on dry ground once again. (Ge 8:14-18)
